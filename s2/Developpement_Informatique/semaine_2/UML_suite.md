# UML Suite: Classifications and Relations
We will be seeing how to create a *UML* for an entire program. I.E. many classes.

## Classification
- The identification of all the classes needed to create a program. 
- Identification of *Attributes*, *Properties*, and *Methods* needed.

### Why Classification?
- A Program is composed of a multitude of classes. Organizing them is necessary.
- Every class has its **Unique Responsibility**

### Advantages
- Allows *reusing* of classes
- Agility in *conception* and *implementation*
- Better for *Testing* of Application
- Better *Evolution* and *Maintainability*

## Relations
1. Assosiation
2. Dependances
3. Composition

Assosiation vs Aggregation
same cycle de vie?
Composition: one without the other.

Adding constraints on number of elements in classes.
Multiplicit√© can have intervals.
